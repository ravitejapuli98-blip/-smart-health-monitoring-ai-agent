# Smart Health Monitoring AI Agent - Demo Video Script

## Video Overview (3 minutes)
**Title**: "Smart Health Monitoring AI Agent - Autonomous Healthcare with AWS Bedrock"

---

## Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

### Visual: Project title screen with AWS logo
**Narrator**: "Welcome to the Smart Health Monitoring AI Agent - an innovative solution that autonomously monitors health data and provides intelligent medical insights using Amazon Bedrock."

### Visual: Architecture diagram animation
**Narrator**: "This AI agent addresses the critical challenge of fragmented health monitoring by automatically collecting, analyzing, and acting on health data from multiple sources."

---

## Scene 2: Problem Statement (0:30 - 0:45)

### Visual: Split screen showing current healthcare challenges
**Narrator**: "Traditional health monitoring is reactive, fragmented, and requires manual intervention. Our agent solves this by providing proactive, continuous, and intelligent health monitoring."

### Visual: Key problems highlighted
- Manual health data collection
- Lack of real-time analysis
- Delayed medical interventions
- Fragmented health information

---

## Scene 3: Solution Overview (0:45 - 1:15)

### Visual: Agent architecture with AWS services
**Narrator**: "Our solution uses Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet for medical reasoning, AWS Lambda for serverless processing, and integrates with multiple health data sources."

### Visual: Key components highlighted
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Medical reasoning and decision-making
- **AWS Lambda**: Autonomous health monitoring
- **External APIs**: Wearable devices, health apps, medical records
- **Real-time Analysis**: Continuous health assessment

## Scene 4: Live Demo - Autonomous Monitoring (1:15 - 2:00)

### Visual: Terminal/console showing agent startup
**Narrator**: "Let's see the agent in action. Here, we're starting autonomous health monitoring for a user with hypertension and diabetes."

### Visual: Code execution showing:
```python
# Starting autonomous monitoring
monitoring_result = await agent.start_autonomous_monitoring(
    user_id="demo_user_001",
    monitoring_config={
        "age": 35,
        "medical_conditions": ["hypertension", "type_2_diabetes"],
        "medications": ["Metformin", "Lisinopril"]
    }
)
```

### Visual: Real-time data collection animation
**Narrator**: "The agent autonomously collects data from wearable devices, health apps, and external medical APIs, then uses Bedrock's medical reasoning to analyze patterns and identify potential health concerns."

### Visual: Analysis results displayed
- Health data points collected: 15
- Medical analyses performed: 8
- Alerts generated: 2
- Recommendations created: 5

---

## Scene 5: Emergency Response Demo (2:00 - 2:30)

### Visual: Emergency alert simulation
**Narrator**: "When critical health issues are detected, the agent autonomously handles emergency situations. Here, we simulate a critical blood pressure reading."

### Visual: Emergency handling process
```python
# Emergency alert handling
emergency_result = await agent.handle_emergency_alert(
    user_id="demo_user_001",
    alert_data={
        "symptoms": {"chest_pain": True, "heart_rate": 150},
        "severity": "critical"
    }
)
```

### Visual: Multi-channel notifications
**Narrator**: "The agent immediately assesses the situation using medical reasoning, determines the appropriate response level, and automatically notifies emergency services, healthcare providers, and emergency contacts."
